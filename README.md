* OpenJourney
* Analog Diffusion
* PortraitPlus
* Elden Ring Diffusion
* Stable Diffusion 2.1
* Stable Diffusion Long Prompts
* Future Diffusion

* Anything v4
* Waifu Diffusion

Upscaling / facefixing from:

* Codeformer (facefix)
* Real-ESRGAN
* Swin2SR
* GFPGAN (facefix)
* Swinir
* Rundalle-sr
* Esrgan

Includes the ability to enhance a prompt using AI via the DistilGPT2 Stable Diffusion V2 model.

Copy a FMX TImage directly from the client into the Delphi IDE!

Built with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/) using the FireMonkey framework this client works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (and maybe Android+iOS) with a single codebase and single UI. At the moment it is specifically set up for Windows.

It also features a REST integration with Replicate.com for providing Generate Image functionality within the client. You need to sign up for an API key to access that functionality.
